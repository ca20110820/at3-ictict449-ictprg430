## Vision

To provide a modern, real-time parking space availability system for the City of Moondalup, helping drivers easily find available parking spots in public parking lots and improving overall parking experience and traffic flow.

## Background

The city is looking to create a proof-of-concept (POC) to digitize their existing parking resources. The project is a low budget project to add sensors to **uncontrolled** parking lots (ones without a gate) in order to provide drivers and city administrators with live information about parking availability.

## User Stories

### User Story 1

As a driver, I want to know the number of available parking spots in a parking lot so that I can quickly find a spot to park my car.

### User Story 2

As a driver, I want to see the current temperature and time while checking for parking availability so that I can plan my activities accordingly.

### User Story 3

As a parking lot manager, I want to track cars entering and leaving the parking lot in real-time so that I can manage parking resources effectively.

## Technical Backlog Items

1. Develop a Python application to count cars entering and exiting the parking lot using SenseHat sensors.
2. Implement an MQTT broker to publish the parking lot updates, temperature, and time.
3. Develop a Python application to display parking availability, temperature, and time on a suitable display.
4. Ensure proper data handling and error prevention (e.g., no negative parking spots).
5. Update the configuration file format to use TOML with the required attributes.

## Definition of Done

1. Cars entering and exiting the parking lot are accurately tracked, and a running total of available spots is maintained.
2. Parking availability updates, temperature, and time are published via MQTT.
3. Parking availability, temperature, and time are displayed in a user-friendly format on a suitable display.
4. The system is tested and runs seamlessly on a Raspberry Pi with the SenseHat.
5. The code is well-documented, object-oriented, and follows best practices.
6. The configuration file is in TOML format and contains the required attributes.

## Functional Requirements Summary

1. The system must count cars entering and exiting the parking lot.
2. The system must maintain a running total of available parking spots.
3. The system must publish parking availability updates, temperature, and time via MQTT.
4. The system must display parking availability, temperature, and time on a suitable display.
5. The system must use a TOML configuration file with the required attributes.

## Non-Functional Requirements Summary

1. The system must be written in Python and run on a Raspberry Pi with the SenseHat.
2. The system must use an object-oriented programming approach.
3. The system must display the parking availability updates in real-time.
4. The system must provide a user-friendly interface for drivers.
5. The system must handle edge cases, such as full parking lots and more cars than available spots.
6. The system must be compatible with the City of Moondalup's TOML-based software management practices.

## Updated Configuration File Example (TOML format)

```toml

[config]
location = "Moondalup City Square Parking"
total_spaces = 192
broker_host = "localhost"
broker_port = 1883
```
